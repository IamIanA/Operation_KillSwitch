Specifcations:
    Feature #1: Class LinkedNode
        Purpose: A single Node that stores an integer ID, a double value, and a pointer to the next node.
        Assumptions: 
            - id is an integer and is an identifier for the node.
            - data is a double and is the data associated with the node.
            - next points to the next node and initializes it to nullptr.
        Inputs: int new_id and double new_data
        Outputs: A new node object with initialized fields
        State Changes: 
            - The ListNode constructor initializes all member variables.
            - The destructor deletes the next node to clean it up. 
        Cases and Expected Behavior:
            - Expected to create a Node
            - Also expected to delete the Node
