3) how you divided the work among your group members:

To divid the work among the group I used a google sheet and 
created a table of different tasked that needed to be acomplished.
The chart can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmEHvThoLqYWN4RGbgEASjSHlgDrBIuIG3cwAA2xAtE/edit?usp=sharing
Each member of the group had specific tasks which were assigned to them
at the start of the project.
